# JavaScript Calculator

A basic calculator web app, originally built with React. On February 12, 2021, I remade with JS only.

Here's a summary of what was done during refactoring:
* Cleaned HTML and CSS in general
* React wasn't really needed
* Rebuilt the entire functionality with JavaScript
* Restyled the app
